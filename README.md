Project Overview
This project analyzes the 2019 sales performance of The Ace Supermarket using Microsoft Excel-based analytics and dashboards. The goal was to transform raw transactional data into actionable business intelligence supporting strategic decisions on operations, marketing, inventory management, and customer engagement. The dataset, sourced from Kaggle, includes 17,000+ transaction records covering product lines, customer demographics, branch information, revenue, payment methods, and gross income.

Key Discoveries
•	Product Performance: Electronic Accessories sold the most units, while Food & Beverages generated the highest revenue, highlighting different sales and profit drivers.
•	Branch & City Performance: Naypyitaw and Branch C were the strongest performers across gross income.
•	Customer Insights: Members purchased slightly more than Normal customers, and female customers generated higher total gross income.
•	Payment Behavior: E-wallet and Cash payments were nearly tied, showing a balanced mix of digital and traditional preferences.
•	Profitability Trends: Strong correlations were observed between product line performance, city location, and branch success.

Identified Problems
•	Underperformance in the Health & Beauty category despite industry growth trends.
•	Near-equal payment distribution indicates slow digital adoption, requiring stronger digital incentives.
•	Subtle performance gaps across branches and cities signal uneven customer engagement.
•	The dataset’s yearly scope limits visibility into seasonality, demographic influences, and long-term trends.

Methodology
